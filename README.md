## About

This repository contains ECI's dotfiles üü¢, configuration files üìÅ for the Company's various tools and applications. We use dotfiles to keep our environment consistent across machines üíª and codespaces.

The dotfiles in this repository work on both Linux üêß and macOS üçé. For Linux, we use Ubuntu üêß with the Bash shell. For macOS, we use the Zsh shell with Oh My Zsh.

The src directory contains standardized aliases, functions, and other scripts that the dotfiles use. The install script updates your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file to source the files in the src directories. After installing, you can use the aliases and functions in your terminal.

The bin direcotry contains scripts that you can run from the command-line. The install script adds the bin directory to your PATH so that you can run the scripts from anywhere.

## Installation

To install the dotfiles, clone this repository to your üè† üìÇ and then üèÉ the following commands:

1. Clone the repository on your local machine:

    ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:ec-intl/dotfiles.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the dotfiles directory:

    ```bash
        cd dotfiles
    ```

3. Run the install.sh script stating the shell you are using, for example, if you are using bash:

    ```bash
        ./install bash
    ```

4. Finally, source your shell's configuration file, for example, if you are using bash:

    ```bash
        source ~/.bashrc
    ```

Once you complete the installation steps, you will see a welcome message üìú.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the dotfiles, run the following commands:

1. Navigate to the dotfiles directory:

    ```bash
        cd dotfiles
    ```

2. Run the uninstall.sh script stating the shell you are using, for example, if you are using bash:

    ```bash
        ./uninstall bash
    ```

The uninstall script will remove the dotfiles from your home directory and restore your shell's configuration file to its original state.

## Getting the latest version

To get the latest version of the dotfiles, run the following commands:

1. Navigate to the dotfiles directory:

    ```bash
        cd dotfiles
    ```

2. Run the update.sh script stating the shell you are using, for example, if you are using bash:

    ```bash
        ./update bash
    ```

The update script will pull the latest version of the dotfiles from the remote repository and update your shell's configuration file to source the files in the src directories.

## Customization

If you want to customize the dotfiles, edit the files in the dotfiles directory and rerun your shell's configuration file. You can add your own aliases, `.env` files, and functions to corresponding files in the `$HOME/bash-src` or `$HOME/zsh-src` directories. The install script will automatically source these files when you run it.
